# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

This project is a very simple program called FizzBuzz. It essentially goes from number 1 to 100 and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it would print "FizzBuzz", if it's only divisible by 3, then it would print Fizz. If it's only divisible by 5, then it would print Buzz. Otherwise if it's divisible by neither 3 or 5, then it would print the number we're currently on.
